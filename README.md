# openChatApp
The opensource iOS AI interface.

## 🏁 Core Goals

The goal of this application is to easly use:
- Your own AI inference endpoints for example the OpenWebUI API
- Connecting to known AI inference endpoints like Mistral, Gemmini and OpenAI

During development more goals can be brought up these will be brokendown into smaller items and be listed at the issues tab.

## 🔥 Motivation

While using OpenWebUi I was missing a usefull application for iOS. When searching [Online](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/3031) I found multiple users wanting such application.

### 🦾 Technolgy

It has been chosen to work with Swift and SwiftUI for two reasons: 
- there is already a OpenWebUI app for [Android](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/3031#discussioncomment-12959086) personally I have not tested this application.
- The personal use of an iOS device.

## 🙏 Belives

I personally belive in a privacy focused applications that don't connect to external API's, there fore the application will adhere to these rules:
- No extra data will be stored externally which will require modifcation to API's.
- No server of EnumBit will intercept or communicate with the application in any way, unless there would be logical reason for it such as notifcations of an updated privacy policy, updated terms of service.
- No server of Enumbit will have access to chats, endpoints, keys, analytical data.
- If many users are asking for one particular feature this will be rearanged to a more urgent category

## 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒 Community

EnumBit has currenlty a size of 1, and is registered as a sole proprietorship. Some development goals will take longer to achive, this is why I am asking for patcience.
